## Setup

### 1. Get FreeAgent API Credentials

#### Register Your Application

1. Go to the [FreeAgent Developer Dashboard](https://dev.freeagent.com)
2. Log in with your FreeAgent credentials
3. Create a new application with these settings:
   - **Name**: Choose any name for your MCP server
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3456/oauth/callback`
   - **Description**: Optional description
4. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

#### Get OAuth Tokens

**Option A: Using npx (Recommended)**

The easiest way to get your OAuth tokens without cloning the repo:

```bash
npx freeagent-mcp-vercel get-tokens YOUR_CLIENT_ID YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

**Option B: Clone and Run Locally**

```bash
# Clone and setup this repository
git clone https://github.com/WavingCatApps/freeagent-mcp-vercel.git
cd freeagent-mcp-vercel
npm install

# Run the OAuth token script
npm run get-tokens YOUR_CLIENT_ID YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

The script will:
1. Open your browser to FreeAgent's authorization page
2. After you approve the application, redirect back to a local server
3. Exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens
4. Display the tokens in your terminal

**Example output:**
```
Add these tokens to your Vercel environment variables:

FREEAGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
FREEAGENT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard, add the following environment variables:

**Required:**
- `FREEAGENT_API_URL` - FreeAgent API URL (default: https://api.freeagent.com/v2)

**Optional, but recommended, Security:**
- `ENDPOINT_PATH_SUFFIX` - Random string to make your endpoint URL unpredictable (e.g., `x7k9m2n8p4q1r5s`)
  
  Generate a secure random string with:
  ```bash
  # Using Node.js
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"
  
  # Using OpenSSL
  openssl rand -hex 16
  ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è ATTACHMENT IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS**: 
- Attachments must be uploaded to FreeAgent via the web interface or mobile app first
- AI tools cannot upload binary files - they can only reference existing attachments by URL
- FreeAgent's API does not provide a way to list/discover attachments - you must know the attachment URL from the FreeAgent interface
- **Attachment URLs are impossible to see on the mobile app and not immediately obvious on the web interface**
- **Workaround**: Use FreeAgent's Smart Capture feature to automatically extract data and create expenses/explanations (limited to 10 smart captures per month for most customers)

Use the `describe_tools` command within your AI platform to see all 46 available tools with their complete parameter specifications.

**üí° Smart Capture Alternative**: For automated receipt processing, consider using FreeAgent's Smart Capture feature instead of manual attachment handling. Smart Capture automatically extracts data from receipts and creates expenses/explanations, though most customers are limited to 10 smart captures per month (additional captures available as a paid extra).

## Security Features

This MCP server includes several security measures:

- **Request validation**: Only allows requests from legitimate AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, AWS Bedrock), development tools (GitHub Copilot, VS Code), and MCP inspector tools
- **Rate limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP address
- **CORS protection**: Restricts cross-origin requests to legitimate domains
- **Optional URL suffix**: Add `ENDPOINT_PATH_SUFFIX` environment variable for URL obfuscation

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally with Vercel CLI
vercel dev

# Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy
```

**Local testing:** Security validation is relaxed in development mode to allow MCP inspector tools.
